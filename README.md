In this respository I demonstrated skills using python to perform analysis of mock election data and scenarios.  

## Project Overview

2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
